## Google Dinosaur Game - Artificial Intelligence

Google Dinosaur Auto-learning using Neural Networks

### About the project
The idea is to use Neural Networks to find the best Dinosaur by using Natural Selection (Random Mutations).
The game was recreated from scratch (without engines) using Java.

The Neural Network was created with 3 layers and Sigmoid as the activation function:
- Input Layer with 6 sensors
- Hidden layer with 6 neurons + 1 bias
- Output layer with 3 neurons (Jump, Down, Airplane)

The population size used to train was between 1000-2000 dinosaurs.

The learning time was between 30 and 60 minutes.

### Fight the AI 
**ChromeDino.rar**: Contains 2 jars (Normal game mode and 1x1 mode)

Keyboard Commands:
- Jump (ARROW UP)
- Down (ARROW DOWN)
- Airplane (A)
- Reset Game (ENTER)


### Code
Inside the "data" folder there is another folder called "synapses", the file inside this folder is the training.
Delete this file if you want to train the Neural Network again.
